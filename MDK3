git clone https://github.com/charlesxsh/mdk3-master.git

cd mdk3-master
make
sudo make install
sudo /usr/local/sbin/mdk3

When I type make I get: make: *** No rule to make target 'osdep/libosdep.a', needed by 'mdk3'.  Stop.
git clone git://git.kali.org/packages/mdk3.git
patch <makefile.patch #<patch the source to get rid of "undefined reference to pthread_create" while doing make
make
make install
